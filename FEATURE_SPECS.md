# Multi-Modal Model Runner - Feature Specifications

## Overview
Convert the existing single-model script into a flexible multi-modal framework that supports both text-only and multi-modal (text+image) models from Hugging Face Hub.

## Key Changes Required

### 1. Processor Upgrade
- Move from `AutoTokenizer` to `AutoProcessor` for multi-modal support
- Handle both text-only and vision-language models seamlessly

### 2. Dynamic Input Handling
- Support text-only input (existing functionality)
- Support mixed text-and-image input for multi-modal models
- Graceful fallback for unsupported model types

### 3. Model-Agnostic Generation
- Use `AutoModelForCausalLM` for consistent model loading
- Implement flexible generation parameters
- Handle both text and multi-modal responses

### 4. Initial Target Model
- Primary target: `Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B`
- Should work with other compatible multi-modal models

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup
- [x] Create requirements.txt with necessary dependencies
- [x] Set up pyproject.toml for project configuration
- [x] Create sample_data/ directory for test images
- [x] Create image generation script for testing

### Phase 2: Core Logic Refactoring
- [x] Implement `setup_model()` function with AutoProcessor
- [x] Implement `generate_response()` function with multi-modal support
- [x] Add image loading and preprocessing utilities
- [x] Update error handling for multi-modal scenarios

### Phase 3: Main Execution Flow
- [x] Update `main()` function for image loading
- [x] Add command-line arguments for image input
- [x] Implement orchestration between text and image processing
- [x] Add comprehensive logging and error reporting

## Testing Requirements
Following TDD approach:
- Write tests for each function before implementation
- Test both text-only and multi-modal scenarios
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Performance testing for model loading and generation

## Dependencies
- torch>=2.0.0
- transformers>=4.35.0
- Pillow>=10.0.0
- accelerate>=0.20.0
- pytest (for testing)

## Success Criteria
- Support for both text-only and multi-modal models
- Seamless user experience with proper error handling
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Performance optimization for model operations
- Clear documentation and examples
